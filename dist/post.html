                        <p>
                            In a very short time, Greta Thunberg—with her searing stare, Pippi Longstocking braids, and
                            hand-painted sign reading SKOLSTREJK FÖR KLIMATET—has become a global icon. A year ago, the
                            16-year-old Swedish climate activist began striking from school each Friday to protest
                            climate
                            inaction; last Friday, she gave a speech to hundreds of thousands of people in New York, at
                            the
                            Global Climate Strike, which was inspired by her protest.
                        </p>

                        <p>It is always at least a little unfortunate to see a young person become an icon—it robs them
                            of
                            the privacy of growing up. But Thunberg is an especially flummoxing figure. She looks
                            younger
                            than her years, yet her speeches take a shaming, authoritative tone that is, at the very
                            least,
                            unusual for a child. “How dare you? You have stolen my dreams and my childhood,” she told
                            world
                            leaders at the United Nations today. She has also said that money and eternal economic
                            growth
                            are “fairy tales.” So she has inspired both public adoration and malign theorizing (mostly
                            centered around the power of her parents).</p>

                        <blockquote>Last week I had the chance to meet the girl behind the image. She is, thankfully,
                            still a
                            person. And she is even more than that: She’s a teenager.</blockquote>

                        <p>In fact, I think her extreme teenager-ness may be key to her influence.</p>

                        <p>Thunberg and a handful of other young climate activists were receiving the Ambassador of
                            Conscience Award from Amnesty International in Washington, D.C., last Monday. In the past 17
                            years, Amnesty has given the award to other icons: Nelson Mandela, Colin Kaepernick, and Ai
                            Weiwei. Backstage, grizzled men in their 40s exchanged boisterous handclasps. Interns and
                            assistants buzzed around: anxious, helpful, and attuned to hierarchy. Somewhere Maggie
                            Gyllenhaal was in a dressing room.</p>

                        <p>Yet when I saw Thunberg—in jeans, sneakers, and a pink tank top—she seemed small, quiet, and
                            somewhat overwhelmed. Thunberg has Asperger’s, which she calls her “superpower,” and which
                            she
                            says allows her to be more direct and straightforward about climate change.</p>

                        <p>Read: Greta Thunberg is right to panic</p>

                        <p>When we got to a room apart from the hubbub, I asked her how she was managing the onslaught
                            of
                            attention. “When I am around too many people, I just shut off my brain, in a way to not get
                            too
                            tired, because I cannot take everything in,” she told me. “It’s hard to be the center of
                            attention; I don’t like that. I have to tell myself it’s for a good cause. I am trying to
                            say
                            something with all this attention, to use my platform to do something good.”</p>

                        <p>Her answers were direct but earnest. She sometimes searched for an English word. Unlike
                            politicians and book-touring authors who have been brain-poisoned by media training, she
                            answered the questions posed. When I asked whether there was a climate fact that caused her
                            particular worry, she frowned and first said she could not think of any one fact in
                            particular.
                            Then she added that she was worried about what she’d heard would be in the upcoming UN
                            Intergovernmental Panel report on sea-level rise. Same, Greta.</p>

                        <p>She is strikingly nonradical, at least in tactics. Unlike other young climate activists—such
                            as
                            members of the Sunrise Movement in the United States, which is led by college students and
                            early
                            20-somethings—she rejects specific policy proposals such as the Green New Deal, instructing
                            politicians instead to “listen to the science.” She has even declined to endorse a specific
                            platform in the European Union, where her “Fridays for Future” movement has taken hold. When
                            I
                            asked how other teenagers should fight climate change, she said, “They can do everything.
                            There
                            are so many ways to make a difference.” Then she gave, as examples, joining an activist
                            movement
                            and “also to, if you can, vote.”</p>

                        <p>When I wondered aloud whether young people’s rights are underrepresented in the political
                            system, she demurred. “Sometimes it feels that way, yeah,” she said. “The problems we care
                            about
                            the most are usually not the ones that are being prioritized the highest. Young people are
                            very
                            concerned about the climate crisis and ecological crisis, and that is very
                            underrepresented.”</p>

                        <p>Photos: Climate-change protests around the world</p>

                        <p>Though perhaps she is moderate in speech, she can be radical in action. Thunberg’s chosen
                            form
                            of protest—a school strike—is uncommon in the United States, though more popular in Europe.
                            Americans think of school as something that chiefly benefits students, not society;
                            comparing it
                            to a job, where a labor stoppage is a recognized form of protest, is outside our ken. But if
                            you
                            come to see school as part of an intergenerational exchange of welfare—students go to school
                            now, so that in 30 years they can get jobs and pay Social Security taxes—then it aligns well
                            with Thunberg’s overall point, which is that older generations have betrayed young people
                            today
                            by failing to address climate change. This almost economic argument has the virtue of being
                            accurate.</p>

                        <p>And when Thunberg talks about this, especially in private, she sounds a lot like … a
                            teenager.
                            “We are not the ones who are responsible for this, but we are the ones who have to live with
                            these consequences, and that is so incredibly unfair,” she said at one point.</p>

                        <p>And this is the way to understand Thunberg that paints her as neither a saint nor a demon but
                            that still captures her appeal. Thunberg epitomizes, in a person, the unique moral position
                            of
                            being a teenager. She can see the world through an “adult” moral lens, and so she knows that
                            the
                            world is a heartbreakingly flawed place. But unlike an actual adult, she bears almost no
                            conscious blame for this dismal state. Thunberg seems to gesture at this when referring to
                            herself as a “child,” which she does often in speeches.</p>

                        <p>When I spoke with her, I asked whether she felt this dual position: the burden of awareness
                            mixed with the lack of blame. “Yes, definitely,” she said. “Because we are so young, our
                            perspective on the world, our perception of the world is so—is so, like, blank. We don’t
                            have
                            that much experience. We don’t say, Oh, we cannot change this because it’s always been this
                            way,
                            which a lot of old people say. We definitely need that new perspective to see the world.”
                        </p>

                        <p>Perhaps that is why adults find her so unnerving. “This child—and she is a child—has been
                            scared
                            and her parents are letting her be controlled by that fear,” writes the right-wing
                            commentator
                            Erick Erickson, who blames her parents for “depriving her of a sound education so she
                            can
                            lecture grownups.” Jonathan Tobin, at The Federalist, worries that the shoe is on the
                            other
                            foot: Thunberg has “forced her parents to adopt a vegan diet” and “bullied her mother to
                            give up
                            her career because it involved air travel.”</p>

                        <p>These may seem like exaggerated concerns, but Erickson and Tobin are really just
                            engaging in a
                            great American tradition: In this country, even before we greet you, we ask whether
                            you’re being
                            parented wrong.</p>

                        <p>Other arguments against Thunberg’s rhetoric can and should be made; if she wants to
                            participate
                            as an adult citizen, she should be criticized like one. But in The New York Times,
                            the
                            journalist Christopher Caldwell takes maybe the oddest line of all, claiming that
                            Thunberg’s
                            message is antidemocratic. “Democracy often calls for waiting and seeing. Patience
                            may be
                            democracy’s cardinal virtue,” he wrote. “Climate change is a serious issue. But to
                            say, ‘We
                            can’t wait,’ is to invite a problem just as grave.”</p>

                        <p>I want to thank Caldwell, because he reminded me of my own childhood. About 20 years
                            ago, I was
                            at a restaurant with my parents, reading a kid’s science magazine below the table.
                            In a small
                            box at the bottom of the page, it mentioned something called the greenhouse effect,
                            caused by
                            cars and factories. The effect could eventually screw up the entire planet’s
                            environment.

                            <p>My head jolted up. I interrupted my parents’ conversation, which was about
                                something boring,
                                like real-estate prices or which highway to take home.</p>

                            <p>“Is this real?” I asked, pointing at the magazine.</p>

                            <p>Oh yeah, definitely, one of them said.</p>

                            <p>“Is it getting fixed?” I said.</p>

                            <p>No, no, people don’t really know how to fix it.</p>

                            <p>And then I remember feeling something constrict in my chest. It was like the
                                adult feeling of
                                learning that a loved one is in danger, of seeing the comfortable world teeter
                                on its axis.
                                There was a problem with the entire planet, and everyone was just allowing it to
                                go on?</p>

                            <p>In 1999, Caldwell was older than I am now, and the United States had virtually no
                                national
                                climate policy. Since then, I have gone to middle school and high school,
                                graduated from
                                college, moved across the country twice, spent years as a technology reporter,
                                and covered
                                climate change for four years. Since then, the concentration of carbon dioxide
                                in the atmosphere
                                has soared from 364 to 415 parts per million. But since then, the United States
                                still has passed
                                virtually no new national climate policy.</p>

                            <p>Caldwell is right that patience is a democratic virtue. But sloth is a cardinal
                                sin. Perhaps
                                only the young can tell the difference.</p>
